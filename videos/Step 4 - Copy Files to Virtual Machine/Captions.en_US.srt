00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,200
Let's navigate to Resource Groups and find our resource group

2
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:14,532
Here we are in our resource group. Let's find our Virtual Machine and click on that. 

3
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:22,566
I switched to Visual Studio Code and created a terminal window in the directory of my project. 

4
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,599
Now I'm logging into Azure

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,100
Now that I've logged into Azure through my Visual Studio Code terminal window, I am going to go back to the portal and start my Virtual Machine

6
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:42,832
A public IP internet protocal address is allocated and my virtual machine is ready

7
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:48,499
You can copy the IP address from the portal but let me show you another way to get it from the terminal window. 

8
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:54,766
For this command I am listing all IP addresses for this resource group and virtual machine

9
00:00:54,933 --> 00:01:00,866
Here is the IP address and the allocation method is dynamic because we were cheap and wanted to save money on our project. 

10
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:08,133
Next we are using secure copy to transfer the files from our web app directory to our virtual machine. 

11
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:22,099
Next we will be prompted to login. You may receive a fingerprint prompt, type yes to agree. You may have to type in your password. 

12
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,399
After logging in, you will see an exciting display of file transfer.

13
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:34,099
Let's run the secure shell command to remotely connect to our virtual machine using our username and password.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,666
Let's navigate to our web app directory and list the contents. You can see everything has copied over. 

15
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:48,566
After you're done playing with your Virtual Machine don't forget to go to the portal and stop it.
