00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:04,833
Let's create a Resource Group for our project

3
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,399
One way to create a Resource Group is to find

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:19,866
a resource via the Create a Resource button in Azure and just type it up, so this is showing me creating a resource

5
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:26,866
you can create it by that path, but an easier way is to just go back to your

6
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,932
home screen and to create a resource via the Resource Group

7
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:38,366
All I am doing here is just clicking on the Create a Resource button and I am going to give it a name

8
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:48,766
for our project. Just a side note you are not charged for just creating an empty Resource Group , so you don't get billed for

9
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:52,632
creating Resource Groups without any resources in them
