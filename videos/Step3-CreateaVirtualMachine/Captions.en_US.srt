1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,466
Let's create a Resource

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,366
Virtual Machines are found under the Compute category

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Make sure you select Virtual Machine and not Virtual Machine Scale Set, and then click Create

4
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,899
Let's walk through the wizard process

5
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,133
Select the Resource Group where to store our resource

6
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,166
Enter a valid virtual machine name

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,266
Select the size for the Virtual Machine

8
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,999
It may take a moment for the cost to load

9
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,833
Sort ascending to find the cheapest size

10
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,966
Review the Virtual Machine size for your project needs

11
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:40,299
Yes, it's true. You can resize the Virtual Machine after creating it.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,200
Select the virtual machine size. 

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,966
Let's setup our administrator account

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,666
Select the password option. Enter a username and a password.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,333
Let's look at the setup wizard for disks.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,466
I don't need any changes here so I am going to look at the Networking tab. 

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,833
By default, Azure includes settings for a new virtual network.

18
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,966
If you have an existing virtual network, you can add this virtual machine to that network.

19
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:05,666
Make sure you have the inbound port rules turned on and click the Management tab. 

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,699
We don't need advanced monitoring so let's disable boot diagnostics. 

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,266
For this project, let's leave the rest as defaults. 

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,400
Let's take a look at advanced settings. 

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,700
For this project, let's leave the defaults. 

24
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:21,699
Click on tags to add custom tags. But's go ahead and Review and Create. 

25
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:35,232
Here you are going to see an estimate of the costs of your virtual machine and some additional terms and conditions to review.

26
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:39,599
Make sure you carefully review all the settings before you click on the create button.

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,833
Let's create the virtual machine and get this project started. 

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,266
It could take awhile to create a virtual machine. So here is a good idea. Go get a cheeseburger and eat one while you are waiting,

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,766
You'll receive a notification that your resource has been created. 

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,766
Click on Go To Resource

31
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:11,933
Let's take a look at the overview of our newly created and currently running virtual machine. 

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,766
Azure created a temporary public IP address for when our virtual mcahine is running.

33
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:21,732
Click on Stop to stop the virtual machine. 

34
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:27,699
Keep your project cheap and reduce costs. Make sure to stop your virtual machine when you are done working on it. 

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,366
It will take awhile to stop and the status will change to Deallocating

36
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:41,232
The final status should say "Stopped Deallocated" and you will now see that your public IP has disappeared.
